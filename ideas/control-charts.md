Control Charts
==============

Control charts are a statistical tool that can be used to monitor product quality attributes for conformance to specifications. Control charts can be applied to monitor both product or process quality.

A product quality attribute is a measurable attribute like startup time, processing time (for a mathematical analysis application), color accuracy (for a photography application), or look up accuracy (for a mapping application). Control charts can be used to visually document the acceptable specification limits for an attribute and the ability of the product to perform within those specifications.

A process quality metric used by software development organizations is the rate at which defects are introduced into source code (perhaps, bugs per source code commit or bugs per line of code). Applying control charts to software defect rate may help a team determine if they are experiencing an increased or decreased defect rate, in which case itâ€™s worth asking why, or if things are about the same.
