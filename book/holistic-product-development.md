Holistic Product Development
============================
This collection of articles is grounded in the belief that systems, whether products or services, are holistic entities. Great designers consider software, physical design, and electronics. It isn't necessary to be an expert in all of these areas, after all that's why products are created by teams, but it helps to get conversant with each domain of skill.

Empathesizing with the Software Perspective
-------------------------------------------
When I got started with Agile I read a lot about automated testing, yet since I was coming from industrial and systems engineering where I didn't work with much software code I didn't conceptually undestand what people meant by automated testing. I read and read, but still couldn't quite figure it out. Then, I stumbled across [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org) by Michael Hartl and was reminded of the value of learning by doing.

Chapter 1 is called [From Zero to Deploy](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#top) and takes the reader through hands on examples of source code revision control with Git and deployment on the Heroku platform-as-a-service.

Chapter 3, [Mostly Static Pages](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#top), introduces automated testing. Few topics are more confusing on paper, yet more clear after a few simple, hands-on examples.

I recommend strongly recommend the first three chapters of Rails Tutorial to anyone getting started with Agile development, of course if you're serious about Rails keep reading the rest of the book too!

Empathesizing with the Physical Perspective
-------------------------------------------
Maybe something about SketchUp and 3D printing could go here?

Empathesizing with the Electronics Perspective
-------------------------------------------
Maybe something about Arduino could go here?
